### Hello, world!

#### Welcome to our blog (this is in the docs folder)!

Our blog is called A Bit Derivative. This is because we reckon that none of the content that we create will be truly original, so our bits of information will tend to be derivative. It's also a math blog, and derivatives are basically the machinery behind modern science, so there ya go.
