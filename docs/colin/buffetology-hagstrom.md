## Buffetology-Hagstrom Screener

The Buffetology-Hagstrom screener, in essence, lookings for growing companies with strong dividends who will continue to grow in the future, and are available at a reasonable price. This document will define the components of the Buffetology-Hagstrom screener adapted from the American Association of Individual Investors and adapted by Dr. William Bowen.

1.  Must have an average 3-month volume, the average number of shares traded per day for the previous 3 months, greater than $100,000$.

1. $$EPS_0 > EPS_2 > EPS_5 > EPS_9$$

This is a Buffetology-inspired criterion that the company should have consistent earnings growth (measured in earnings per share) over the past 10 years.

1. (  "EPS [Now] " *  "EPS [Y1] " *  "EPS [Y2] " *  "EPS [Y3] " *  "EPS [Y4] " *  "EPS [Y5] " *  "EPS [Y6] " *  "EPS [Y7] " *  "EPS [Y8] " *  "EPS [Y9] " )>0

This is another Buffetology-inspired criterion that says that the company must have no negative earning years over the past 10 years.

1.  ((  "Return on Equity [Now] " +  "Return on Equity [Y1] " +  "Return on Equity [Y2] " +  "Return on Equity [Y3] " +  "Return on Equity [Y4] " +  "Return on Equity [Y5] " +  "Return on Equity [Y6] " +  "Return on Equity [Y7] " +  "Return on Equity [Y8] " +  "Return on Equity [Y9] " )/10)>=15

This is another Buffetology-inspired criterion that says the company should have had an average return on equity of at least 15\% over the last 10 years.

1.   "Long Term Debt [Now] " <=(5*  "Net Income [Now] " )

This is another Buffetology-inspired criterion that says the company's long term debt should be less than 5x the annual earnings.

1. ((  "ROIC [Now] " +  "ROIC [Y1] " +  "ROIC [Y3] " +  "ROIC [Y4] " +  "ROIC [Y5] " +  "ROIC [Y6] " +  "ROIC [Y7] " +  "ROIC [Y8] " +  "ROIC [Y9] " )/10)>=12

This is yet another Buffetology-inspired criterion that says the company's average return on invested capital (ROIC) over the past 10 years should be greater than 12%. 

1.   "Price / Cash Flow [Now] " /  "Operating Income 5-Year Avg (%) [Now] " <2 and  "Price / Cash Flow [Now] " /  "Operating Income 5-Year Avg (%) [Now] " >0.2

This criterion says that the price-to-cash flow, normalized by the 5-year average operating income, should be less than 2, but greater than 0.2. This criterion requires that the price not be too high relative to the current cash flow and a rolling average of operating income. 

1. Net Margin vs Industry > 0

The company's net margin minus the average of its industry.

1. Operating Margin vs Industry >0

The company's operating margin minus the average of its industry. 

Operating margin measures how much profit a company makes on a **dollar of sales after paying for variable costs of production**, such as wages and raw materials, but before paying interest or tax. It is calculated by dividing a companyâ€™s operating income by its net sales. To calculate the operating margin, divide operating income (earnings) by sales (revenues).
