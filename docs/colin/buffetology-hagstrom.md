## Buffetology-Hagstrom Screener

The Buffetology-Hagstrom screener, in essence, lookings for growing companies with strong dividends who will continue to grow in the future, and are available at a reasonable price. This document will define the components of the Buffetology-Hagstrom screener adapted from the American Association of Individual Investors and adapted by Dr. William Bowen.

1.  Must have an average 3-month volume, the average number of shares traded per day for the previous 3 months, greater than $100,000$.

1. 

\begin{equation}
EPS_0 > EPS_2 > EPS_5 > EPS_9
\end{equation}

$$EPS_0 > EPS_2 > EPS_5 > EPS_9$$

This is a Buffetology-inspired criterion that the company should have consistent earnings growth (measured in earnings per share) over the past 10 years.

1.  ((  "Return on Equity [Now] " +  "Return on Equity [Y1] " +  "Return on Equity [Y2] " +  "Return on Equity [Y3] " +  "Return on Equity [Y4] " +  "Return on Equity [Y5] " +  "Return on Equity [Y6] " +  "Return on Equity [Y7] " +  "Return on Equity [Y8] " +  "Return on Equity [Y9] " )/10)>=15

This is another Buffetology-inspired criterion that says the company should have had an average return on equity of at least 15\% over the last 10 years.
