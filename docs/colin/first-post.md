# If Happiness is Anticipation with Certainty, Then I'm Unhappy

### A short exploration of energy, information, and their impacts on health


While reading Toni Morrison's *The Bluest Eye*, I came across a rather innocent line that has stuck with me the moment I first heard it. I found the book on Audible, on  the recommendation of my new friend to listen to audiobooks on trail runs, though I quickly realized that her soothing voice was not exactly the inspiration I needed to push through the last mile in 90 degree weather. Clocking in at over 7 hours, I could only sweep the floor and do laundry so many times before I ran out of the mundane medium that suits audiobooks so perfectly. 

I decided ultimately to purchase the book from Barnes and Noble, where an old friend's employee discount saved me a dollar and 50 cents. After reading just the first few pages, I was surprised to come up to the quote that I had belabored to reach in the audiobook. The two young sisters who befriend Pecola--Claudia and Frieda--are introduced to Mr. Henry, a guest of their parents:

*"Want a penny?" He held out a shiny coin to us.
Frieda lowered her head, too pleased to answer. I reached for it. He snapped his thumb and forefinger, and the penny disappeared. Our shock was laced with delight. We searched all over him, poking our fingers into his socks, looking up the inside back of his coat. **If happiness is anticipation with certainty, then we were happy.** And while we waited for the coin to reappear, we knew we were amusing Mama and Daddy.*

If happiness is anticipation with certainty, then we were happy. Happiness occurs when we are able to look forward to something, and have no doubt that it will happen. Certainty is something that we believe to happen with probability one. To use the probabilistic term, it happens *almost surely.* However, if there is some degree of uncertainty, then can we be truly happy? There is a collection of outcomes, finite, countably infinite, or uncountably infinite, and unless we are omniscient, then we cannot be guaranteed any one outcome. If there was a non-zero probability that the penny disappeared forever, then Claudia and Frieda would not be able to go to the store to get a Mary Jane candy.
